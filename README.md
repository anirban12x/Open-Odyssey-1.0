### Here is a quick reference guide for GitHub: [GitHub Guide](https://github.com/git-guides)

> [!TIP]
> Aim to make more than 4 pull requests.
> Imagine you've only made 4 pull requests to different projects, but one of those projects isn't part of the Hacktoberfest event.
> In that case, your pull request won't be counted, leaving you with just 3 valid ones if those projects aren't excluded either.
> To ensure your success, I recommend making a pull request to your own repo, as long as it has the Hacktoberfest topic.

### Wait for Pull Request to merge

### Celebrate - you've done your first pull request!!
